I am **Director of AI** for imaging at the [Chan Zuckerberg Inititative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) where I lead research focused on advancing biomedical science with AI.

Previously, I was a **Turing Fellow** at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk), the UK's national AI institute, and **Associate Professor** at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). I conducted my postdoctoral research in the physics department at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu) and gained my Ph.D. from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk).
