I am a **Turing Fellow** at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) where I run a research group of computer scientists focused on the application of Artifical Intelligence (AI) to problems in the life sciences. I also run an interest group dedicated to the topic of [learning the organisational principles of living systems](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/learning-organisational-principles-living-systems). We are building intelligent systems capable of determining the basic operating principles of biology.

I am also an **Associate Professor** of biophysics at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk) (UCL) where I run a research group comprising  a team of physicists, computer scientists and biologists. We develop state-of-the-art quantitative imaging and measurement tools. I teach topics ranging from biochemistry to optics, imaging and machine learning.

I gained my Ph.D. in biophysics from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk) and conducted my postdoctoral research in the physics department at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu), before moving to London to take up a faculty position at UCL.
